    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);

    team[3] = 'Lux';
    // Note: If you update an array it will always reference back, which isn't what happened in the last example

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    console.log(team2);
    // Note: Running slice on the original array without referencing any numbers will actually just take a copy of the whole array

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    // also can do:
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy (but it doesn't):
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;
    // console.log(person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });
    // Above we are taking a blank object, copying person, and then folding in our own info
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.


    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes)

    // In console, do dev.social.twitter = '@coolman', it will change both

    // If you need to go deeper, go online and find function called "clone deep"
